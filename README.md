# dcloud

A no-code testing framework.

## Installation

1. Add @dcloud as a collaborator on your repository.

That's it! There's nothing to install and no dependencies.

## Writing your first test

You don't write tests! This is a no-code framework, remember?

Just commit your code as you normally would and tests will appear in a few weeks.

## Testimonials

> I've used dcloud on several of my projects and love the results. No-code testing frameworks are the future of software development.
